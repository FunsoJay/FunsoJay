### 🧠 About Me

I'm a **Data Enthusiast** specializing in **Business Intelligence**, with a strong focus on transforming data into meaningful, visual stories that drive decision-making. With over **a year of hands-on experience**, I’ve worked across banking, logistics, and energy — turning messy datasets into dashboards, insights, and value.

- 🔍 I thrive on asking the right questions and uncovering patterns behind the numbers.  
- 🎯 I believe great data work is equal parts curiosity, clarity, and communication.  
- 🌍 I’m driven by the belief that **when used right, data doesn’t just inform — it transforms how we understand and act.**
